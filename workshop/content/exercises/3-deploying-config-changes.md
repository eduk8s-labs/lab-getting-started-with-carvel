# Deploying configuration changes

We mentioned previously that one of the benefits of `kapp` is that it can notify us of what changes are being made before we decide to accept the change. To show this in action, let's make a change to the application configuration to simulate a common occurrence in a development workflow.

If you remember, the deployment resource for our application in the file `config-step-1-minimal/config.yml` set an environment variable `HELLO_MSG`. This was set to "stranger". Change the value of this environment variable to "somebody" by running:

```
sed -ibak -e "s/stranger/somebody/" config-step-1-minimal/config.yml
```

Now re-run `kapp`, but this time add the `--diff-changes` option to tell it to show us what changes have been made.

```
kapp deploy -a simple-app -f config-step-1-miiff-changes --yes
```

You should see similar output to the following:

```
@@ update deployment/simple-app (apps/v1) namespace: default @@
  ...
117,117           - name: HELLO_MSG
118     -           value: stranger
    118 +           value: somebody
119,119           image: quay.io/eduk8s-labs/sample-app-go@sha256:5021a23e0c4a4633bfd6c95b13898cffb88a0e67f109d87ec01b4f896f4b4296

```

You can see how it displays the difference between what is currently being used and what you want it to be set to.

You will again be prompted as to whether you want to continue with the changes. Enter `y`.

The change should then be applied.

Succeeded
```

In the future, we will provide a `-y` or `--yes` flag to go ahead with the changes without prompting us. The default though is to always prompt if you want to continue.

The above output highlights further features of `kapp`:

* `kapp` detects changes to resources by comparing the given local configuration against the live version already deployed to the cluster
* `kapp` can show changes in a git-style diff by supplying the `--diff-changes` flag
* `kapp` will only re-apply resources which were changed, so since the service resource was unchanged, it was not re-applied to the cluster during the apply changes phase
* `kapp` waited for pods associated with a deployment to converge to their ready state before exiting successfully

To double check that the change was applied, run:

```
curl http://simple-app.default.svc.cluster.local:8080 && echo
```

and you should see

```
<h1>Hello somebody!</h1>
```

One of the key features of `kapp` mentioned above is that when detecting changes it will compare against the live version already deployed in the cluster. Because it compares against what is live in the Kubernetes cluster, `kapp` does not really care where the application configuration you want to apply comes from, you do not even need to have the new configuration stored as files in the filesystem.

What this means is that one can use `kapp` with any other tools that produce Kubernetes configuration, for example, if you were using `helm` you could run:

```
helm template my-chart --values values.yml | kapp deploy -a my-app -f- --yes
```
> DO NOT attempt to run this in the terminal session as this example is only for illustrative purposes

In this case the output from `helm` command is piped directly into `kapp`. You could do a similar thing using other tools such as `kustomize`.

You can therefore start to see how the Carvel tools are designed in the UNIX philsophy of small individual tools designed to perform one task, that can be composed together to create more complex workflows. Such workflows are not restricted to being composed of just tools from the Carvel project.
