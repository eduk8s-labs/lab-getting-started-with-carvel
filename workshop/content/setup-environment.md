This workshop environment provides you with a Kubernetes cluster to use when running the exercises covered by this workshop. To verify you can access the Kubernetes cluster, run `kubectl version` in the terminal by clicking on the action block below.

```execute
kubectl version
```

The workshop uses these action blocks for various purposes. Anytime you see such a block with an icon on the right hand side, you can click on it and it will perform the listed action for you.

To version what versions of the Carvel tools we will be using, you can run:

```execute
ytt --version
```

```execute
kbld --version
```

```execute
kapp --version
```
